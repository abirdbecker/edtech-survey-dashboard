    "I think there's a lot of research showing that computers of any kind are a distraction in class and lead to cognitive overload. I'm a college professor and anecdotally I see major deficits in attention, critical and creative thinking, as well as basic social interaction. I ban all devices in my own classes for this reason.",
    "These devices are a nightmare for kids with issues with attention span/executive function deficits. They are a massive source of distraction in school and out of school. Some kids are absolutely addicted to screens, and we should not be feeding that addiction at school.",
    "These devices are not issued by school but they are required. They are hugely counterproductive. The impact on attention, focus, social skills, and most importantly mental & emotional health is huge. The school is also reliant on our kids cell phones. Their regular & continuous use is embedded in school day and curriculum.",
    "I sometimes find out my child has been onscreen a lot during the school day. I never hear from the school or teacher about how much screen time is expected and intentionally integrated in the curriculum - how much liberty is the teacher taking with screens to make their life easier vs how much screen time is part of evidence-based strategies to prepare our…",
    "Have had multiple instances with both children being exposed to inappropriate/ mature content on their school devices, despite school filters. Both of my children have ADHD and screens exacerbate that. My oldest also uses their school device as an 'escape' during class when they are overwhelmed.",
    "I believe it's a slipperly slope and hard to do minimal use.  Meaning I am essentially ok with the minimal screen time they have (although I do think my 2nd grader has slightly too much of it), however I believe they just shouldn't use it in school in general.  Even in small amounts, I wish it was banned altogether.",
    "My kids' school district will implement a bell-to-bell policy for the 2026-2027 school year, but each school decides how to implement it. I fear that this will enable the entire policy to be undermined to the extent that it won't result in the positive impacts we want for the kids.",
    "When our now 3rd grader was in 1st grade, we had some concerns that it felt like they were constantly on their ipads in school."
